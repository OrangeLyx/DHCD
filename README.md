This topic focuses on the numerical solution of two unique forms of differential equations, namely the second-order mixed problem based on convective diffusion and the second-order marginal value problem with rescaling. :star:  

The numerical solution is shown and contrasted with the analytical solution during the convergence analysis of the algorithm, which employs the tabular approach to obtain the convergence order. The physical characteristics of the fluid and the real environment of the oil spill location are combined in the numerical analysis of the convection and diffusion issue. The boundaries of the solution area eventually cause changes in the type and status of the oil leak concentration by arbitrarily choosing the marginal conditions. The reconditioning problem's solution and the convective diffusion problem's analysis show how differential equations work both in theory and in reality.

The answer to the description of the numerical algorithm will be added in July 2023. :smiley: I wish to support students who are researching differential equation numerical solutions.
